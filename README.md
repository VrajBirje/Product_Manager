# Product Manager

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description: 

Product Manager is a web application designed to manage products efficiently. It allows users to perform essential operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting products. The website is developed using ReactJS with additional support from Node packages. CSS and Material UI are employed for styling, and the development environment is Visual Studio Code.  

## Features: 

## Display Products

Utilizes a GET API to fetch and display all products in a table.
Products can be conveniently searched using the provided search bar.

## Add Product

Incorporates a POST API to add a new product to the list.
Displays a success message upon successful addition.
Inputs undergo validation before making the API call.
Note: The assumption is made that only 30 products are displayed by default, which may affect the visibility of newly added products in the table.

## Edit Product

Employs a PUT API to edit product details.
Success message is displayed upon successful modification.
Input validation is implemented before initiating the API call.
Note: Assumption is that changes made are not permanent, and reloading the site reverts to the old data.

## Delete Product

Utilizes a DELETE API to remove a product from the list.
Displays a confirmation message upon successful deletion.

## Consistent Components

Includes components such as Top Bar, Side Bar, and Progress Indicators that are present on all sections/pages of the website.

## React Router

Utilizes React Router for seamless navigation between different sections/pages of the website.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
